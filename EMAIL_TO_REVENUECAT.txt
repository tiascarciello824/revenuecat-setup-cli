Subject: OAuth Client Registration Request - RevenueCat Setup CLI

Hi RevenueCat Team,

I'm developing an open-source CLI tool to streamline RevenueCat integration for React Native and Expo developers. The tool automates the entire setup process: creating projects, configuring apps, setting up products/entitlements, and generating integration code.

To provide the best user experience, I'd like to implement OAuth authentication so users can simply login with their RevenueCat account instead of managing API keys.

I'd like to register an OAuth client with the following details:

**Client Information:**
- Client Name: RevenueCat Setup CLI
- Client Type: Public (CLI/Desktop application)
- Client URI: https://github.com/tiascarciello824/revenuecat-setup-cli
- Description: Automated setup tool for RevenueCat integration in React Native/Expo apps

**Redirect URIs:**
- http://localhost:3000/callback
- http://127.0.0.1:3000/callback

**Required Scopes:**
- projects:write
- apps:write  
- products:write
- entitlements:write
- offerings:write

**Use Case:**
The tool helps developers automatically:
1. Create and configure RevenueCat projects
2. Set up iOS and Android apps
3. Create subscription products with trials
4. Configure entitlements and offerings
5. Generate TypeScript integration code
6. Set up Supabase webhooks (if applicable)

Users will authorize the tool via OAuth flow in their browser, and the tool will then perform all setup operations on their behalf.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Authorization Code flow with PKCE (S256)
- Local callback server on port 3000
- No client secret (public client)

Could you please register this OAuth client and provide me with the client_id?

Thank you for your support!

Best regards,
